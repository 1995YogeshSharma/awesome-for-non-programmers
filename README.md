# Awesome for non-programmers

A list of Open Source projrect where you can contribute without any programming knowledge.

Inspired by the [Awesome First PR Opportunities](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/).


## The projects

* [Code And Talk](https://github.com/szabgab/codeandtalk.com) collecting data about tech conferences in JSON files. The README has links to the file describing how to add [Events](https://github.com/szabgab/codeandtalk.com/blob/main/docs/EVENTS.md) to the "database".
* [Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/) Mozilla's initiative to help teach machines how real people speak.
* [LanguageTool](https://community.languagetool.org/) Open Source proofreading tool
